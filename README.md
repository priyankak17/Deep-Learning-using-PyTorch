# Deep-Learning-using-PyTorch
Repo contains overview of DL and why and How PyTorch is used with usecases and executed project

Deep Learning with PyTorch
Limitations of Deep Learning
Model Explainability [Refer to papers 1.]

Unpredictable outputs leading to unknown errors

DL model require much larger dataset

Machine Learning
Deals with structured data
XGBoost algorithm typically used in Datascience competitions and in productions
Other algorithms used are random forest, tree based algorithm, etc.
Algorithms:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosted Models

Naive Bayes

Nearest Neighbour

Support Vector Machines

Deep Learning
Better used for unstructured data
Using Tensor unstructured data like images can be turned into a structure
Algorithms:

Neural Network

Fully connected Neural Network

Convolution Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Network

Transformer

PyTorch deals with 1st 3 algorithms

Neural Network
INPUT LAYER --> HIDDEN LAYER --> OUTPUT LAYER

Input can be images, audio, text, which will encoded into computer readable format - Numeric form, then features/weights will be adjusted to recognise that image/text

eg: Resnet 152

Types of Learning
Supervised
UnSupervised
Transfer
PyTorch
Popular DL framework used by AI Agriculture, tesla autpilot, META AI, Microsoft, openAI etc.

Tensor
The numerically encoded data that is converted from raw data(image/audio/text) is called tensor. PyTorch is based on torch dot tensor.
